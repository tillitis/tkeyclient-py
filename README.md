# Tillitis TKey Python package

This is a Python package for interacting with the Tillitis TKey.

The goal is to implement the TKey protocol, including a small client that can be used to do the following:

- Get the name and version
- Load an application

The protocol implementation will start with the parts required to perform the above, but it may be extended in the future.

## Disclaimer

This package has been developed and tested using a TKey of the following version:

`Firmware name0:'tk1' name1:'mkdf' version:5`
